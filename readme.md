# Extra time
The last thing I had to do was spent the remaining 20 hours on something that will bennefit my (d3)JS skills.

## What I did

* d3 terms explanation
* d3 library changes from v3 to v4
* d3 basic tutorial
* codecademy JS 

### d3 terms explanation

While making my assignsment I ran into a lot of trouble. Mainly not understanding what the code means. I searched the internet and read articles about it. This gave me a better understanding in d3. Reading everything and trying to make some stuff took me 3 hours.

### d3 library changes from v3 to v4

When searching for examples online I saw a lot of v3 versions. Sometimes I took the v3 version and made it to v4 myself. I researched online to what the main differences were and how I could change it. Reading everything and practicing it took me 3 hours.

### d3 basic tutorial

I tried following online tutorials for learning how to make charts myself. unfortunately, the only video tutorials I came across were made in v3. Lucky for me, I learned how to change stuff from v3 to v4 so it wasn't really that big of a deal. Watching the video and making the same chart took me 4 hours.

### Codecademy JS

I can read JS easily, but writing it is kinda difficult. I started going to CodeCademy and try the "Introduction to Javascript" course. It started pretty basic, but I soon saw some stuff I never really understood. I am still doing the course, because its really helpfull. The time I have spent in this course (for now) is 10 hours.
